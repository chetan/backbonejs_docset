# Backbone.js DocSet

A Backbone.js DocSet for use with [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash/)


## Usage

Open Dash > Preferences > Docsets > Download Docsets; Click **+** and paste the following url:

    https://raw.github.com/chetan/backbonejs_docset/master/BackboneJS.xml

Then click *download* next to the new item at the bottom of the list.



## Manual Import

Clone the repository or download and extract the tarball from the *downloads* page. You should then be able to *doubleclick* the .docset package. You may want to move it into ~/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets/ or some other permanent location as it won't do this for you.
